		<p>Four days and no interaction<br />
Just the sound of your voice<br />
Brought me to a complete state of satisfaction<br />
Yet here I stand and there you are<br />
Walking about as if I don&#8217;t exist<br />
Waltzing around a simple conversation<br />
from someone you&#8217;ve seen half naked</p>
<p>If getting to know me<br />
isn&#8217;t what you want then by all means<br />
and with all respect due<br />
I will ever so kindly and politely,<br />
With all the grace that God Almighty has bestowed upon me,<br />
Chuck these slender, chocolate deuces at u<br />
And take my leave</p>
<p>&#8230;because I knew it would end this way<br />
The odds weren&#8217;t stacked in our favor<br />
And I could see the end before we even pressed start<br />
To try, at some extent, to play the clip of a romance<br />
That bloomed from the seed of our friendship<br />
Weeks and months would blend together and<br />
Our&#8230;or my feelings, would grow<br />
Only to get cut short by you</p>
<p>An unworldly love that failed to see the light of day<br />
Something that would&#8217;ve been ours<br />
Could&#8217;ve been ours<br />
Or at least&#8230;<br />
I hoped it would be ours.</p>

		<p>I can’t remember a moment<br />
where they haven’t been brought to my attention.<br />
“I seen your momma, so you obviously got ‘em from her.”<br />
“What kind of greens you’ve been eating?”<br />
“Stop being greedy and share girl!”<br />
If only these were blessing that I asked for…</p>
<p>A blessing lined with a curse<br />
Growing up I never felt comfortable with them<br />
They never fit into any of the jeans designed<br />
With my skinny friends in mind</p>
<p>Being the butt of jokes<br />
because my backside refused to let me fit in<br />
I could never hide them<br />
no matter what I tried<br />
they remained<br />
And yet know these are the curves that women crave<br />
The hips they pay for<br />
The sway they die for<br />
Same hips I was taught to hate<br />
Lead my stride as I walk away<br />
laughing at the irony of life</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was the day. Diane had been waiting all week for this day, and knowing that it was here brought a certain atmosphere of anxiety to her house. Her mother had been in a frenzy since Monday even after Diane came home from school.</p>
<p>She had barely walked through the front door of her home when her mother ran past her calling, “Sweetheart, can you take out the dishes and set the table for me? Your Aunt Emma is coming in a few days so I want everything ready for her arrival.”</p>
<p>“Okie doke, Mom! Even though we just cleaned the house two days ago,” Diane mumbled as she took the fancy china dishware from the cabinet in the dining room. After she placed a dish and utensils in front of each chair, Diane took it upon herself to start dusting. “Might as well, before Clare the Cleaning Lady returns and demands the house be spotless”, she said to herself as she moved the feathered wand across some old family pictures on the wall. In its center was a wedding picture of her parents. Diane surveyed the happiness of the youthful couple in the photo, their bright smiles drawing attention to the joy evident in their faces. She recognized that same look in her parent’s eyes still, despite being married so many years ago.</p>
<p>Allowing herself to become swept up by her family wall of photos, Diane slowly moved across the room as her eyes witnessed snapshots of countless memories taken by her parents. What always stood out to Diane was the lack of her baby pictures within photos of her family and relatives. Asking her mom about the whereabouts of her baby pictures had almost become a routine between her and her mother.  “Mom! Could you come here for a sec?” Diane called for her mom from her spot in front of the off-white wall, never moving her eyes from the photos in front of her.</p>
<p>“Yes? Oh Diane! Did you start dusting in here? Good thinking, Sweetie!” Clare clasped her daughter’s shoulders and gave them a squeeze.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Diane had been so engrossed in her thoughts, that she hadn’t heard her mother encroach on her space. “Oh, yeah” she started as she brushed her mother’s concern for tidiness to the side. “It’s clean, whatever. Soo, about these pictures on the wall…where are my baby photos? I see all of our family and stuff, but I don’t see me.” Diane quietly turned to face her mother as she awaited her answer.</p>
<p><em>Was that a flinch?</em> Diane thought she saw movement in her mother’s face, almost a slight twitch near the budding crow’s feet of her left eye. “I already told you, hun. When you were little and we were just moving into this home, the storage company we used lost some of our boxes. ”</p>
<p>Diane let her eyes fall to the floor as she thought about her mom’s answer. “Really? How?”</p>
<p>Clare groaned as she dramatically placed her arms on her hips, making her child chuckle. “Diane, must we go into this now? Your aunt will be here tomorrow, and I still have to start on the laundry. Now Sweetie, be a help and finish dusting in here please? I can’t have Aunt Emma thinking we don’t keep the house in decent shape.” Clare said. She gave her daughter a smile and a quick nudge of the elbow and hurried towards the kitchen, in pursuit of dirty clothing.</p>
<p>Diane laughed at herself as she watched her mother scurry around their home, trying to fix things up and do some last minute cleaning. The three bedrooms and two bathrooms of the Lacey home usually remained in tip-top shape, especially since some of Diane’s weekly chores included vacuuming and organizing each room in the two floor abode she called her place of residence. She always thought this funny because her mom ran herself ragged just to get a few tiny things off her lengthy to-do list done. “Sure thing Mom. I’ll get right on that.” Diane instantly dropped the duster where she stood and made her way over to the living room. She plopped herself down on the couch and turned on the TV, hoping to find something that could calm the jitters in her stomach. Diane always got excited when time moved closer to her Aunt Emma coming into town. Diane had the average life of a 9<sup>th</sup> grader; she went through the motions at school, barely being noticed by the upperclassmen loitering in the halls. Diane had hardworking and loving parents, but sometimes their work caught up to them and they spent less time at home. Aunt Emma always managed to bring the fun with her whenever she was in town, and Diane looked forward to the change in pace at home as well as an added distraction.</p>
<p>Now not that her aunt was a bad woman, but Aunt Emma was dealing a <em>slight</em> drinking problem. No one in the family really judged Aunt Emma for her behavior, mainly out of respect; she was getting old and she wanted to spend her elder years enjoying what little time she had left. There was no relative in the family as giving as Aunt Emma and although no one would admit it, her family felt responsible for not preventing her drinking habit. She placed so much importance on the lives of everyone else in the family, and yet somehow they managed to let Aunt Emma develop a habit that she could no longer control. <em>Having her visit will be entertaining</em>, Diane thought. <em>What could actually go wrong?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>The next evening, the front doorbell blared as the person on the other side kept pressing the button repeatedly, as if waiting for two seconds for someone to open the door was just too much for them.</p>
<p>Diane’s father slowly came down the stairs, rolling his eyes and adjusting his tie on his way to the door. “I’m coming Aunt Emma, I’m coming! Just give me a second,” he said.</p>
<p>“Well hurry up! I’m 68 years-old; I’m not getting any younger, ya know!” Aunt Emma yelled from the other side of the door. “Open up so I can put this luggage down!” she laughed as she waited outside.</p>
<p>Diane’s mother met her dad at the door and raked his brunette hair with her fingers. He began straightening out the cardigan she wore as they prepped each other by the door and opened it together. “Aunt Emma!” they both said, happy to see her yet nervous that she may have had a drink before arriving.</p>
<p>“Well hey there, you two! Ron, you look amazing! How’s your job going? Clare, your new hair looks marvelous! I see you tried that new hairstyle we talked about. Now, where is my Diane?” Aunt Emma asked as she crossed the family threshold. She dropped her bags as she waited for Diane to come around the corner. “Diane? Where are you darling?”</p>
<p>“I’m right here Aunt Emma!” Diane came out of the family room and rushed to embrace her aunt. Despite her drinking, Diane loved her Aunt Emma with all of her heart and truly enjoyed getting to spend time with her when she came in town. She ran into her aunt’s arms and squeezed her tight in a massive bear hug, and Aunt Emma took in the sight of her growing niece as she began with her questions. ”So sweetheart, did that advice work?”</p>
<p>Clare’s voice piped in, exposing her shock. “Advice? What advice, Diane?”</p>
<p>“Uuuhhh…just something Aunt Emma said on the phone a while back. Nothing big”, she ended as she erupted into a fit of nervous giggles.</p>
<p>“Are you sure honey? If something is going on, you know you can come to your mom right? You can tell me anything.” Clare placed a concerned hand on her daughter’s shoulder. Since when did she not know what was up with Diane?</p>
<p>Aunt Emma reclaimed her place in the conversation. “Clare honey, don’t worry about it. It was one of those little trivial situations most high schools subject their families’ ears to hearing.” She snorted at her own joke and winked her wrinkled eyelids at a slightly worried Clare.</p>
<p>Diane playfully nudged her aunt with her elbow. “Well you never complained while I was dishing the dirt over the phone!”</p>
<p>“I got so wrapped up in the story that I couldn’t help but listen. It’s like a soap opera, those high schools!” Aunt Emma snickered, then turned to Clare. “If you want, I’ll catch you up after dinner. Diane darling, show me to the living room. I’m ready to sit so you can catch me up on how you’ve <em>really </em>been. Just between us girls!”</p>
<p>Diane couldn’t help but smile as she led her vivacious Aunt Emma to the family room. There, she told her aunt all about her life as a high school freshman: the friends she’d known since the sixth grade, her crushes on guys who barely knew her name, the popular cliques in school who thought they owned the place. By the time Diane was finished filling her in on her average teenage life, Aunt Emma had finished two cocktails in addition to the drinks she had on her flight over. She noticed the change in her aunt’s behavior when she became so passionate about the events that went on in her high school. Diane loved her grandma’s sister, but didn’t she think it was time to slow down? She always worried that her aunt’s decisions would catch up to her one day, but she loved how lively and fun Aunt Emma was as well</p>
<p>“Kids can be so cruel, angel”, Aunt Emma said. “Just ignore those girls when they try to make you all feel down. And those little knucklehead boys? Ya don’t need ‘em darling.”</p>
<p>Much to her surprise, hearing her aunt’s drunken support gave Diane a weird sense of comfort. Despite of couple of slurred words here and there, it seemed as if Aunt Emma was really giving Diane words of wisdom. “Wow. That….actually makes sense. Thanks for that Aunt Emma.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention, sweetheart. That’s what I’m here for!” She leaned over on the couch and handed her empty glass to Diane. “Now, could you do a favor for your aunt? Can you please ask your mother to get me a refill please? You know how your aunt is, Diane.” Aunt Emma chuckled as she watched Diane hold back her laughter out of respect for her mature relative.</p>
<p>“I’m really glad you came Aunt Emma, but I gotta be honest. I was a little nervous. Well…” Clare hesitated as she secretly poured a virgin daiquiri. She decided it was time to cut her off for the night. “You can be…animated when you drink sometimes. I was scared you might not be able to keep it together.”</p>
<p>“Oh of course, honey! Trust me, I’ve been on this earth for a while now. I know how to control myself. Besides, I had more to drink the last time I came to visit.” Aunt Emma laughed at the memory of her own outlandish behavior. Diane had to cover her mouth to hide her own giggles. Her Aunt Emma was all over the place during her previous visit. Her family discovered on this visit that Aunt Emma had the habit of having “loose lips” when she had consumed one too many drinks. “I remember that visit well, believe it or not. I was talking up a storm!”</p>
<p>“Oh I remember! You were a handful during that visit,” Clare said. Diane’s mom stopped to share a laugh with child in the kitchen before she sent Diane out with the non-alcoholic drink.</p>
<p>Aunt Emma continued her random trip down Memory Lane as she grabbed her drink from her niece and thanked her. “Later on I was so happy that Diane was visiting your mom in Dallas, Clare. I was so scared that I was gonna blab my mouth and blurt out that she was adopted in one of my drunken stupors!” Aunt Emma fell over with laughter before she stopped abruptly and looked up at a stunned Diane, suddenly realizing her mistake.</p>
<p>“Diane?&#8230;Diane?!” Clare walked over to her from the kitchen and gently laid her hands on her child’s shoulders. “Diane…your aunt is just a little over her head right now. Diane?”</p>
<p>Diane was frozen in her spot on the couch. She was barely blinking and as she tried to open her mouth to ask her mother if her aunt was right, no sound came could escape from her mouth no matter how much she tried. It was as if everything around her had slowed down, as if reality itself was in slow motion. Diane could see her mother running towards her like a lifeguard saving a drowning victim’s life on the beach. Clare moved with urgency and she called for her husband from his office. As her father entered the room, Diane snapped out of her trance and began to talk. “Dad…is it true?”</p>
<p>Ron looked at his daughter with eyes full of sadness as Clare waited to hear him speak. “Is what true?”</p>
<p>“Am I adopted? I mean, you guys are my real parents…right? Is Aunt Emma just off her rocker??” Diane slowly started to raise her voice at her family. She rose from her spot on the couch and took a step towards Ron when she realized the adults in the room were looking in every direction except hers. “Dad, answer me. Am I your daughter?”</p>
<p>“Yes honey. You are my daughter, no matter what. Your mother is your mother. But we…we aren’t your biological parents.” Ron tried reaching out to Diane, but she pushed him away.</p>
<p>Clare got up and moved towards Diane, who was moving farther and farther away from them and closer to the door. “Diane, we wanted you to find out a different way. Not like this! You have to understand that we planned on telling you-“</p>
<p>“Really? You expect me to believe that? When were you gonna tell me, Mom? Huh? And what about you, Dad? Or should I call you Ron from now on?” At this point, Diane was yelling at the top of her lungs. “And you Aunt Emma? I never would have thought you would help keep this secret. How could you guys?!”</p>
<p>Her dad answered, “Now Diane, try to hear us out. We couldn’t have a child of our own, and the agency we went to told us there was a child that needed a home. We wanted to adopt you, and one day we knew this would come up…but we didn’t expect it to go this way. We wanted to tell you when you were older, when we felt like you could handle the whole truth.”</p>
<p>Aunt Emma stood and walked toward the stairs. Her left hip tried to lock as she moved, but she took her time making her way up in the direction of the second floor. Halfway up the stairs, she turned around and spoke directly to Diane. “I’m so sorry, Buttercup. I never thought in a million years…I didn’t mean to cause all of this. I think it would be best if I just go…” Her eyes filled with tears when she saw the pain in Diane’s eyes. Her intentions were never to hurt her niece.</p>
<p>Diane watched the old woman climb the steps toward the guest room. Her mind was telling her to hate her aunt, but for some strange reason she just couldn’t bring herself to think negative thoughts about her aunt. Whether it was Aunt Emma’s age or the fact that she revealed such a truth, Diane just couldn’t fight the sadness that reached her heart as she watched her elderly aunt travel up to her room. She knew deep down that her aunt would never outright try to hurt her, but the twisting feeling that resided in her stomach reminded her that the situation she faced was real and that her Aunt Emma was capable of hiding the truth from her.</p>
<p>After Aunt Emma finally made it up the stairs, Diane turned to her parents and looked at them with pure anger. “I don’t even know what’s real anymore…who are you people? Why would you keep something like this for so long?”</p>
<p>Her mother wiped her face as she tried to reason with her child. “Diane, you know us. We’re still your parents despite how you’re feeling right now.” Clare’s cheeks were flushed with pink as she tried to calm the situation, but things were already moving out of her control.</p>
<p>“But you aren’t…and that’s the problem.” Diane’s eyes pleaded with the only parents she’s known all her life. The world as she knew it was turned on its axis; maybe she stepped into the Twilight Zone? “How long were you two planning to hide this?”</p>
<p>Ron walked over to his daughter and wrapped her in his arms. He wasn’t quite sure when she grew up, but as he looked down at Diane he remembered the toddler her brought home and realized that he could no longer protect her from pain. “Angel, there’s nothing that I can say to make myself seem innocent in your eyes but I want you to know your mother and I never wanted it to happen this way. These are the feelings we tried to save you from. I guess we didn’t really think that plan through, but we will spend the rest of our lives making it up to you honey. Your mother and I are so sorry we hurt you, Diane.”</p>
<p>His eyes appeared misty from where Diane stood below his shoulders, but she never thought she would actually see a tear fall down his face. In a daze, Diane looked past her father and placed her gaze on Clare. Her mother walked away from them and sat on the couch, her face buried into the palms of her hands while she rested her elbows on her knees. The light from the living room window casted shadows on Clare’s elongated veins while Diane traced them with her eyes, studying each twist and turn. In that moment, she registered that the blood that flowed through those hands was not the same blood that traveled through her own blood vessels. The thought of not having a connection these loving, yet imperfect people who called themselves her parents sent an icy chill down Diane’s spine. She shivered as she began to break the permeable silence in the room. “I think I’m gonna walk for a go- I mean, go for a walk. I just need some air.” Diane picked up her bookbag from its place by the front door and walked straight out of her home, full of tears waiting to be shed and questions waiting to be answered.</p>
<p>Her emotions were taking her on a roller coaster ride. Everything she knew for the last fourteen years had changed, and it was all thanks to her drunk aunt. Diane knew that things got a bit out of control when her aunt was in town, but she had no idea things could ever be this bad. She had no one to turn to and no idea who to believe. There was only one place Diane knew she could go without having to worry about being bothered by anyone. She reached into back pocket of her Levi jeans and pulled out her phone, dialing her best friend within seconds.</p>
<p>“Hey Amber? Could you meet me at the library in fifteen minutes? It’s urgent.”</p>
<p>“Sure….is everything okay?</p>
<p>“No, not at all.”</p>
<p>An hour later, and after completing three comic books, Diane caught Amber up on everything that happened before dinner. She told her everything, including her aunt’s drinking habits and her family’s accidental reveal of adopting her. Amber sat in silence and listened with genuine compassion as her friend of twelve years vented to her in a vacant reading room on the second floor of their neighborhood library. Both girls were spread out on the floor, staring at the ceiling as if looking for answers that would fall from the roof.</p>
<p>“Whoa….adopted. That’s heavy, Diane….”</p>
<p>“I know. My family isn’t my real family. To think I wouldn’t have even known…”</p>
<p>“Well, did you ever suspect anything?”</p>
<p>“From what? My parent’s normal behavior? Trust me, if I knew something I would’ve asked about it a long time ago.”</p>
<p>Amber sat quietly and let the silence consume the space between them. She sighed before she began to speak again. “Diane, are you sure? Nothing gave you any hints?”</p>
<p>Diane thought to herself about the situation. Did she really know this whole time? “Well, I did ask my mom about the lack of baby pictures of me in the family room…and Mom never had an answer to share with me. I don’t know. Maybe I did notice some things here and there…”</p>
<p>“Cut them some slack. They’ve never had an adopted child before. They’re working their way through things.”</p>
<p>“Really Amber? Even though they lied? And on top of that, they weren’t even the ones to tell me. Of all the people…ugh, why did it have to be Aunt Emma? I loved her so-”</p>
<p>“Love her. You love her, Diane. You’re just upset right now, that’s all. Wait…didn’t you say your Aunt Emma was the drunk one?”</p>
<p>Diane chuckled at the thought of her aunt in her element: drink in hand and a cackle of a laugh. “Yeah, I did. So what?”</p>
<p>“So…why are you so upset? If she was drunk when she got there, and then drank some more, don’t you think that she just made an honest mistake and blurted it out? I mean, you should at <em>least</em> think about forgiving her.”</p>
<p>Should she? Diane loved her aunt dearly, but telling her that she was adopted in that way was clearly unforgivable. <em>Wasn’t it?</em> She wanted to stay angry with Aunt Emma, but there was way too much love for her in Diane’s heart to hold a grudge. Her eyes stayed locked on the ceiling as her mind roamed freely, trying to find a way to move on from the day’s activities. “What would you do, Amber? Would you forgive your drunken aunt?”</p>
<p>“Eh. Maybe not at first…but if your aunt bakes homemade cookies anything like my old Aunt Sally then I would definitely give it a shot! Geez&#8230;I wonder if I’m adopted?!”</p>
<p>“Really, Amber? You actually think you could be adopted too?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I look waayyy too much like my parents to be adopted. But what if I was? We could have the same long lost parents!”</p>
<p>“That would be kind of cool though, us being sisters. We would drive our birth parents crazy!”</p>
<p>Both girls rolled in their spots on the ground as they contemplated life as sisters. In that moment, Diane was glad that she called her best friend. Amber always knew how to cheer her up, even if that meant imagining a world where they shared the same parents.</p>
<p>A young couple with a baby approached the check-out desk in the center of the library floor, not far from where Diane and Amber were lying. The two young people appeared to be married and the small, waddling baby was their child. The mother was pushing the stroller as the baby stood in between, “helping” her mom push her seat-on-wheels towards the check-out desk. Diane noticed the love evident in the mother’s eyes as she observed her little one stumbling over her own feet in an effort to keep up. She wondered if her own parents looked at her with the same amount of love and if they did, then why give her up to some strange family? <em>What made them leave her all alone? Did they leave her alone?</em> Diane noticed that the baby girl had round icy blue eyes like the proud father, and had light brown hair sprouting from her head like her mother. <em>Who did she get her brown eyes from? Her brown hair. Did she really get her nose from her mom’s mother? Which relative passed their long legs on to her?</em> How would she ever know the answers to any of the questions that lingered in her mind, as she analyzed this seemingly normal and happy family? She didn’t even know where she came from…yet.</p>
<p>“So what are you gonna do?” said Amber, interrupting Diane’s inner thoughts.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Am. I mean, I just found out my parents weren’t my <em>real </em>parents. I have a lot to think about.”</p>
<p>“Who knew our lives would take off once we got into high school? Growing up is…sucky.”</p>
<p>“Yeah”, Diane started. “That’s a pretty accurate word for it. Just like figuring out who I am from this point on will be: sucky.”</p>
<p>“You can always search for your birth parents one day.” Amber said confidently.</p>
<p>Diane stopped to think about what Amber had said. <em>Is that a good idea?</em> She thought about her situation at home, her loving family waiting for her to return safe and sound. Despite the confusion she felt, Diane knew deep down that her parents truly cared for her. But what about her birth parents? What if they’re looking for her? “Maybe I will. It would be nice to know where I actually come from.”</p>
<p>“Well if you do search for them, count me in!” Amber pointed to herself for emphasis.</p>
<p>Diane sat up and looked at her closest friend. “You would help me look for them?”</p>
<p>“Of course I would! Besides, I wouldn’t wanna miss out on the adventure…Ooh! We could do when we’re older. We can turn it into a road trip!” Once again, Amber’s spontaneous bursts of ideas helped to calm Diane and make her forget about the situation waiting for her when she got home.</p>
<p>When Diane walked through her front door later that night, her parents were waiting for her arrival downstairs in the family room.</p>
<p>Ron stood up and walked over to the door. “Diane honey, it’s starting to get late. Where were you?”</p>
<p>“I went down to the library with Amber. We just sat around and read comic books. That’s all.”</p>
<p>With the sound of the front door closing, Aunt Emma surfaced from her room at the other end of the house. She moved as fast as she could towards Diane and immediately hugged her, forcing fresh tears to fall down her grandniece’s face. “I’m so glad to see that you’re alright honey. I was going to leave, but when I came back down and saw that you were gone…well I had to make sure you came back home safe. You leaving was my fault in the first place.” Aunt Emma walked over to Diane and held onto her shoulders under her fragile hands. “I have to apologize to you darling. I never meant for you to find out that way, especially coming from me. That was something for you parents to share with you when the time was right, and I took that away from them and from you. Please find it in your heart to forgive your old aunt.”</p>
<p>Diane lifted her head to meet her aunt’s eyes. “I understand that it was a mistake, and I want you to know that I’m not upset anymore. I was so mad at you, Aunt Emma, and I couldn’t believe you would just drop something that serious on me, and in that way! But I realized that it wasn’t completely your fault. You were drunk.” She wiped her eyes as suppressed tears threatened to fall.</p>
<p>“Ya know honey, people say that you can’t teach an old dog new trick, but they’re wrong! It’s time for your old aunt to make a change, and tonight was a sign of that. It was never supposed to get this out of hand.” Aunt Emma dropped her head in embarrassment as she struggle to continue. “I’m not sure where I went wrong, but I can guarantee you that your Aunt Emma is going to fix it.”</p>
<p>“You always have been good at fixing problem, haven’t you?” Diane said. She and her aunt shared one last hug, then she watched the youthful old woman carry herself up to her guest bedroom for the night.</p>
<p>Diane’s father broke the silence that grew between them in the room. “Honey, have a seat. Your mother and I would like to-”</p>
<p>“Hey Dad, could we talk tomorrow? A lot was said and done, and I kinda want to put today behind me.” Diane said as she stretched as if exhausted from the day’s events. She admitted that she had plenty to ask her parents, but she also knew that that was a subject she would rather tackle on a different day.</p>
<p>“That’s fine, honey. We have all weekend to talk about it,” said Clare.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Mom.” Diane turned around and walked out of the family room, making her way towards the staircase. As she reached the fourth step, Diane overhead her parents still in the family room, talking to each other in hushed voices.</p>
<p>“She hasn’t asked us anything yet. We still have some time.” That sounded like her father, Diane thought.</p>
<p>“What do we say when that time comes, Ron? ‘We don’t know?’ At some point the lies are gonna have to stop.”</p>
<p>Diane tipped-toed hey way back down the stairs, making sure to be quiet and not draw attention to herself as she slowly approached the family room from the hallway. <em>What are they hiding from me? </em>Diane thought as she waited to hear them speak.</p>
<p>“I agree,” said her dad. “She deserves to get the truth from here on out.”</p>
<p>“Then we should tell her everything. It settled.” Diane’s mom got up and headed into the kitchen. She returned five minutes later with two mugs of hot tea in her hands and gave one to Ron. “Right?”</p>
<p>“Clare, how do you expect us to tell a fourteen year old all of this?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Ron! How would any couple tell their adopted daughter that her birth parents died years ago? That’s a lot for anyone to handle, so imagine if she went searching around and found out their past and who killed them. I think it would be best if we just wait to tell her everything.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. But I hate having to lie to her.” Ron added.</p>
<p>“So do I. We have to protect ourselves and her. We can’t let anything else get out.”</p>
<p>Diane was breathing as quietly as she could while she stood in her hiding spot in the hallway. She couldn’t comprehend the words that she overheard from her mom and dad. She slid down the wall unto the floor, gripping her knees in front of her as she curled up into a tight ball. Confusion swirled through her mind as she listened to her parents plan out the lies they were going to tell her, hoping to protect their daughter from a truth that she already knew.</p>

		<p>I am the voice of my people.<br />
I am the slave running to freedom alone at<br />
night, heading north on the Underground Railroad.<br />
I am the unheard cry of the young black<br />
boy, hung from a tree and skinned to death</p>
<p>Do you hear my cry?<br />
I am the housemaid, endlessly scrubbing glossed<br />
wooden floors, going home with my personal collection<br />
of splinters in my knees.<br />
I am the inspirational crusader, shot<br />
dead in the head because my opposition feared my thoughts.</p>
<p>Can you fathom my intelligence?<br />
I am the struggle of a black face in a white place,<br />
receiving an education that my history is deleted from.<br />
I am the educator with a message to tell<br />
yet fearful that not enough young ears will hear the stories of their culture.</p>
<p>Will you let me live?<br />
I am the black body lying lifeless in the street,<br />
even though I was only going for a walk.<br />
I am the prisoner in the execution chair,<br />
preparing to die for a crime I did not commit.</p>
<p>So therefore, don’t tell me to be quiet.<br />
Don’t silence my voice, because it is not only mine.<br />
It belongs to those that came before and those who will come after.<br />
This is only the beginning<br />
of our war cry.</p>

		<p><em>A letter I wrote to my father, of all the things I would say to him if I had the chance.</em></p>
<p>I want to start by saying thank you for marrying my mother. I appreciate that because without that bond, there would be no me. Or, I would be someone else&#8217;s daughter and lose all the quirky little unique characteristics and qualities that make me who I am as an individual. The thought of being any different&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t fathom it. And for that, I thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for divorcing my mom. Or maybe I should say, thank you for knowing when to let go. The relationship wasn&#8217;t working, and instead of creating a household dynamic that wouldn&#8217;t foster my growth, you two dissolved the problem by co-parenting. What I&#8217;m more thankful for is the closeness that I share with my mother. If it weren&#8217;t for you leaving, I wouldn&#8217;t be forced to depend solely on her&#8230;.which wouldn&#8217;t give me a reason to spend all my time with her and tell her all my dreams and fears and plans. I might not be as appreciative. Thanks to your absence, my mother is my best friend. All of my earliest memories are with her. All of my happiest moments have had her influence, whether in physical attendance or in spirit aiding me with her advice. And for that, I thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you for having me last (even though that really wasn’t your doing). It’s not that being the youngest isn’t already amazing in itself. (It really is! I’m the baby and the only girl; I’m spoiled rotten!) But God made His plan that way for a different reason. He knew that you wouldn’t be here. He knew you would refuse to repair our relationship, despite living within 20 minutes of my campus. You wouldn’t pick up the phone and you wouldn’t write a letter. Which is why he blessed me with two older brothers. They would be the male figures in my life. What I know of manhood, I learned from them. What I know about fatherhood, I learned from them. What I know of growing up and finding my way through college, I learned from them. I would need a man in my life to teach me things my mom couldn’t, so God gave me two. And for that, I thank Him and I also thank you.<br />
Despite it being your flaw, thank you for your inconsistencies. (If you’re still reading by this point, I appreciate your attention Dad.) It may seem weird, but hear me out. It taught me know to bounce back from disappointments from loved ones. It taught me that people don’t always have your back like they say they do, and it taught me how to have my own back. My mom has been the only person I could ever rely on, and now that she’s older and I’m becoming an adult I’m learning how to stand on my own two feet. I’ve gained an independence that only comes from being knocked down with no one to turn to, and I’m gracious for the nights where I’ve sat by my nightstand debating whether or not I would call you and ask for help. I’ve weathered my past storms alone, without your help. Due to your absence I’ve discovered that I am more than a statistic. Hell, I’m not a statistic. Regardless of having an absentee alcoholic father, I didn’t let that define me and somehow I managed to end up at an Ivy League university. With you being gone, I learned that I could succeed without you. Even though you probably don’t agree with that last statement, I still thank you.</p>
<p>They are few and far in between, but I thank you for the memories we made. I still remember you letting me ride in the front seat of your Jeep as a child when my mom still forced me to ride in my car seat in the back when I was with her. I still remember the pork skins you always bought me when we went to your favorite corner store. I remember we ended all of my Saturday visits with a trip to Barnacles, our favorite restaurant, and you would always laugh because I ordered that the same thing every single time. (By the way, I still order chicken tenders and fries whenever I go out.) I remember you and my brothers playing games with me and coloring with me. I remember the care you put into cooking my dinners, making sure you only cooked the foods my twelve-year-old-picky-eater appetite would allow. I remember us bonding over your music collection and me dancing on your feet. I remember you kissing my face, purposely because you knew I hated your scratchy beard. What I’m saying is that through these memories, I’m left with a reminder that my dad isn’t all bad. My heart will always be able to find peace because I know you love me. I have proof of it. You haven’t always shown it in the best ways, but the memories prove your love for me. And for this as well, I thank you.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to tell you that I thank you for staying away as long as you have. Despite what you may think, there is a positive spin to this. (Or, at least I put a positive spin on it.) You’ve remained a mystery to me. I’m 21 years old, and there are so many things that I don’t know about you. Your favorite color, what foods you’re allergic to….I don’t even know your birthday. (Though I’ve narrowed it down between the 20th- 22nd of January.) The point is that because I don’t know these things, I have a reason to want to get to know you. I have a reason to want to reconnect with you. I have a reason to hold out hope that you’ll call me, wanting to learn all about me and giving me that chance to learn things about you. And I’ll always be thankful to you for that.</p>

		<p><em>A poem that I wrote a while ago in response to the death of Michael Brown.</em></p>
<p>A few days ago, a young man died<br />
Gunned down by his community&#8217;s protectors<br />
Despite his surrendering hands<br />
His life is gone and no one has an answer</p>
<p><em>Please wake up.</em></p>
<p>Unarmed and only 18<br />
He had his whole life ahead of him<br />
Now his goal for attending college will forever be unreached<br />
Because his only chance was taken from him</p>
<p><em>Please wake up.</em></p>
<p>Why was he stopped? Did he provoke the cop?<br />
With every news report the story changes<br />
Yet they refuse to criminalize the officer in question<br />
Will you really let him get away with this?</p>
<p><em>Please wake up.</em></p>
<p>Our people are being picked off one by one<br />
Either by a pale face or by our own<br />
The senseless killing that plagues our community must stop.<br />
Ended by us, and us alone</p>
<p><em>Please wake up.</em></p>
<p>Stop expecting justice from the law<br />
The law lies; wasn&#8217;t designed for &#8220;us&#8221; to have protection<br />
Stop expecting the news to tell the complete truth<br />
The only expectation you should have is them painting us with misconceptions</p>
<p><em>Please wake up.</em></p>
<p>Folks are protesting, looting, rioting&#8230;<br />
Blacks are sick and tired of losing their men<br />
The hand of the white man aiding in American genocide<br />
When will the murders end?</p>
<p><em>Please wake up.</em></p>
<p>We have to unite as a community and fight back<br />
Find our own justice and make our own equality<br />
It is our God-given right to do so<br />
This land owes us our pursuit of happiness, our life, and our liberty.</p>
<p><em>Are you awake yet?</em></p>
